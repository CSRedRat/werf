> _Note:_ This promise was introduced with Werf 1.0 and does not apply to previous versions or to dapp releases.

Werf is versioned with [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). This means that major releases (1.0, 2.0) are
allowed to break backward compatibility. In case of Werf this means that update to the next major release _may_
require to do a full re-deploy of applications or to perform other non-scriptable actions.

Minor releases (1.1, 1.2, etc.) may introduce new "big" features, but must do so without significant backward compatibility breaks with major branch (1.x).
In case of Werf this means that update to the next minor release is mostly smooth, but _may_ require to run a provided upgrade script.

Patch releases (1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2) may introduce new features, but must do so without breaking backward compatibility with minor branch (1.1.x).
In case of Werf this means that update to the next patch release should be smooth and can be done automatically.

Patch releases are divided to channels. Channel is a prefix in a prerelease part of version (1.1.0-alpha.2, 1.1.0-beta.3, 1.1.0-ea.1).
Version without prerelease part is considered to be from a stable channel.

- `stable` channel (1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.). This is a general available version and recommended for usage in critical environments with tight SLA.
  We **guarantee** backward compatibility between `stable` releases within minor branch (1.1.x).
- `ea` channel versions are mostly safe to use and we encourage to use this version everywhere.
  We **guarantee** backward compatibility between `ea` releases within minor branch (1.1.x).
  We **guarantee** that `ea` release should become a `stable` release not earlier than 2 weeks of broad testing.
- `rc` channel (2.3.2-rc.2). These releases are mostly safe to use and can even be used in non critical environments or for local development.
  We do **not guarantee** backward compatibility between `rc` releases.
  We **guarantee** that `rc` release should become `ea` not earlier than 1 week after internal tests.
- `beta` channel (1.2.2-beta.0). These releases are for more broad testing of new features to catch regressions.
  We do **not guarantee** backward compatibility between `beta` releases.
- `alpha` channel (1.2.2-alpha.12, 2.0.0-alpha.5, etc.). These releases can bring new features, but are unstable.
  We do **not guarantee** backward compatibility between `alpha` releases.
