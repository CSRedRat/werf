Werf is an Open Source CLI tool written in Golang to implement your application delivery fast & easy. To benefit from it, you just need to describe your application's configuration (how to build it and deploy it into Kubernetes) in a Git repo acting as the single source of truth. In short, that's what we call GitOps today.

* Werf builds Docker images using Dockerfiles or alternative fast builder based on the custom syntax. It also cleans Docker Registry from unused images.
* Werf deploys your application into Kubernetes using a chart in Helm-compatible format with handy customizations and improved deploy tracking, errors detection and output.

While werf is not a complete CI/CD system itself, it is a tool that can be embedded into any existing CI/CD system literally "connecting the dots" to implement these practices for your application. We consider it a new generation of high-level CI/CD tools.
